# Vanilla-Furniture-Expanded---Security-More-Turrets
 Vanilla Furniture Expanded - Security More Turrets adds few more turrets to play and use to defend your bases.
 
Works with Rimworld 1.1 and 1.2

Not yet approved or seen by the Vanilla Extended team, but it needs the following Vanilla Expanded mods to run:

Vanilla Furniture Expanded - Security & Vanilla Weapons Expanded - Lasers

The turrets might be OP or unbalanced. (especially the Laser, Tesla, and Small Rocket turrets) This mod also adds a Double Artillery Cannon, and a Dual Charge Turret.


The laser and tesla turrets is only usable when you reasearch Laser Defences, a new addition by this mod that is located on the highest tier. (Archotech)


The turrets also have higher power requirements to run.
